## 🔥 What I'm Building Now

- Scaling **Aletheia** into a production-grade RAG platform (hybrid retrieval + grounded answers + ingestion worker queue)
- Improving deployment ergonomics (Dokploy + one-command compose startup)
- Building library-first architecture for **VerTel** (C++ Telegram framework)
